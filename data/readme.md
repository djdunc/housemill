# Data processing

Download csv from grafana dashboard - needed to do in stages since grafana limit on data points it can show. e.g. downloaded oct 2023 to mar 2024, april 24 to july 24 and then aug 24 to spet 24.

Opened in visual studio and merged into one.

The max height script then uses this data to return the dates of all the high tides that touched the floor boards.

The time under water script shows how many minutes the floor boards were under water.
